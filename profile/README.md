## Technician

Context switching is expensive. With Technician, you can stay focused on developing features rather than pesky bugs.

Whenever a runtime exception appears in your logs, Technician automatically creates a pull request to repair the bug.

We currently only support Java applications. Send us an email if you'd like to see a demo!
