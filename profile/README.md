# You found us!

SensorSurf believes in a future of mass automation, where humans are free from mundane labor to focus on creative tasks.

We see robotics as a critical component of this future, so we're building tools to help reduce the complexity of developing robots.

Check out the [SensorSurf Agent](https://github.com/SensorSurf/agent), which enables you to record data on events and offload over poor connections.
